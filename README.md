How To Play:

Control the left paddle to avoid balls with your mouse.
When the left paddle hit balls, you will lose one point.
The less points you have, the faster balls' velocity is. The minimal of the points is zero, the maximal of the points is twenty.
You can use number "1 - 9" to control the number of balls.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
